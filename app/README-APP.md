Phase D: Java Bootstrap

Goal:
Build a working Java application that connects to the existing MySQL database and performs the two main transactions:

T1: Pick Ticket Creation

T2: Picking Process

This phase proves that our Java frontend (Swing + JDBC) can communicate with the database and execute real operations defined in Phases B and C.

⚙️ Setup Guide
1️⃣ Install Requirements
Tool	Version	Purpose
Java JDK	17 or higher	Run and compile the application
MySQL Server	8.0+	Existing database from Phases B/C
MySQL Connector/J	8.4.0 (JAR)	Enables JDBC connection

📂 Place the driver jar inside app/lib/.

2️⃣ Database Configuration


Copy the example file:
app/src/main/resources/dbconfig.properties.example 
→ rename it to: dbconfig.properties


Fill in your actual database credentials:
db.host=127.0.0.1
db.port=3306
db.schema=ccinfom_dev
db.user=your_username
db.password=your_password


(Optional) Use an external config path at runtime:
-Dccinfom.dbconfig=/absolute/path/to/dbconfig.properties


🔐 Never commit dbconfig.properties — it’s ignored in .gitignore.

3️⃣ Building the App
🪟 Windows
build.bat

🐧 Linux / macOS
./build.sh


This compiles all sources under
app/src/main/java/ into app/out/.

4️⃣ Running the App
🪟 Windows
run.bat

🐧 Linux / macOS
./run.sh


If configured correctly, the program will:

Display “Connected to Database” on startup.

Open the Swing window with menu/buttons for T1 and T2.

🧠 System Overview
Architecture
UI (Swing) → Service → DAO → Database (MySQL)


Layers

Layer	Package	Responsibility
Config	com.ccinfom.config	Load properties and manage DB connections
Model	com.ccinfom.model	Represent DB tables as Java objects
DAO	com.ccinfom.dao	Run SQL queries via PreparedStatements
Service	com.ccinfom.service	Apply business logic and transactions
UI	com.ccinfom.ui	Provide user interface for T1 and T2


Testing Checklist
Test	Expected Result
Run MainApp.java	App launches with “Connected to DB”
Create Pick Ticket (T1)	1 header + lines inserted; ticket status = Open
Start Picking (T2)	Picking header + lines inserted; status flips to Picking/Done
Run QA validation queries	No orphan rows / invariant violations


Definition of Done for Phase D

Phase D is complete when:

Java app connects to the database using external config (no hardcoded creds).

DAO and Service layers execute T1 and T2 correctly (end-to-end).

Swing UI forms for T1 and T2 work and reflect actual DB changes.

Validation queries (in /qa/validation_queries.sql) show no errors.

All source files follow the project folder structure and are fully documented with TODO headers.


Maintenance Tips

Keep SQL logic only in DAO classes.

Always close connections (try with resources or finally).

Test each layer individually:

DbConnection → ping MySQL.

DAO → CRUD check via console.

Service → transaction consistency.

UI → end-to-end flow.

Document successful runs in screenshots for QA.

// TODO[E-DOC-XCUT-003] Update README for Phase E workflows.
// Why: Run instructions must include Pack/Dispatch/Close forms, demo scripts, and ServiceTestRunner usage.
// Steps:
//   1) Add new section "Phase E Additions" summarizing T3/T4/T5 flows and launcher buttons.
//   2) Document how to run demo-T1-to-T4.sql and demo-full-flow.sql in Workbench.
//   3) Document how to execute PhaseEServiceTestRunner and expected outputs.
// Acceptance: README reflects latest UI buttons, demo order, and test commands; reviewers can follow without guesswork.
